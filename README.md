# Legal templates

This repository helps Liberate Science openly track boilerplate legal work. All of these templates are free to reuse under a [CC0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).

Filenames follow `<TYPE>-<LANGUAGE>-<REGION>.md`. This means that `employment-contract-de-DE.md` is the German version of the employment contract in Germany, and `employment-contract-en-DE.md` the English version for the employment contract in Germany.  

`<TYPE>` may be multiple words, separated by hyphens and MUST be included.

`<LANGUAGE>` is the [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code (lowercase) and MUST be included.

`<REGION>` is the [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) region code (uppercase). If a document applies to multiple regions, duplicate files are preferred. `<REGION>` MAY be omitted if the document is not region specific.
